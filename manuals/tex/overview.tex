\chapter{Overview}
\sdr is a software-defined radio based on Microsemi's SmartFusion. Unlike common FPGAs, the SmartFusion
is a device which incorporates a hard core ARM Cortex M3 and a flash-based FPGA. Flash-based FPGA
technology offers low static power, no reconfiguration in boot stage and memory retention when in
power down mode. These benefits make it a better candidate for low-power wireless research. We present
the \sdr, a true battery-powered SDR platform which is suitable for portable and deployable hand held
device research.
