µSDR
====

The µSDR is a project aimed to improve the price, power, and portability of
software radios, with an emphasis on technologies around the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

µSDR costs a little over $100 at scale, can power itself via PoE or run
continuously for nearly 8 hours on a pair of AA batteries, and supports full
802.15.4e.
